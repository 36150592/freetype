The *.ttf and COPYING files in this directory were copied from the X.org
project, specifically
http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/individual/font/font-bh-ttf-1.0.0.tar.bz2

There are three typefaces: sans (s), serif (r) and monospaced (m). Each
typeface has four fonts: regular (r) and bold (b), and roman and italic (i).
For example, luxisb.ttf is sans, bold and roman.

The *.ttx files in this directory were generated from the *.ttf files
by the ttx command-line tool.
